            ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
            information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or
            guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with
            Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have
            collected Personal Data from children without verification of
            parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our
            servers.
